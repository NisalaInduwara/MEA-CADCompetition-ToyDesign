# MEA-CADCompetition-ToyDesign
The MEA-CADCompetition-ToyDesign project on GitHub is dedicated to the development and submission of innovative toy designs for the annual CAD competition organized by the University of Peradeniya. This competition is open to all undergraduate students, with the theme of the competition focused on "Toys" for the age group of 3-8 years old.

## Project Requirements:
1. CAD Model: Participants are required to create a detailed CAD model of their toy design using Solid Edge software. The CAD model should showcase the toy's moving parts and working mechanism, utilizing standard components such as nuts, bolts, and engines.

2. Keyshot Rendered Images: Participants should provide visually appealing rendered images of their toy design using Keyshot. These images will highlight the appearance and aesthetics of the toy, showcasing its design complexity and innovative concept.

3. Animation/Video: A video or animation demonstrating the toy's functionality and features should be created. This will provide a dynamic representation of the toy design, showcasing its operability and engaging nature.

4. Presentation Video: Each contestant should create a presentation video, not exceeding 2 minutes, introducing and explaining their toy design. This video will allow participants to showcase their original concept, design choices, and unique selling points of their toy.

The competition consists of two phases. In the first phase, participants submit their initial designs, and outstanding designs will proceed to the second phase. In the second phase, participants will modify their initial designs based on a common modification given to all contestants. An interactive session will follow, where each contestant presents their design to the panel of judges.

To ensure fairness, participants must not publish their designs before the MEA CAD Competition team does so on their social media platform. Any copyright claims will be thoroughly investigated, and the team's decision will be final.

The GitHub repository will host the CAD models, rendered images, videos, and any supporting documentation related to the toy designs. Participants can collaborate, share their progress, and submit their entries through the repository. The documentation will provide guidelines for the setup, installation, and usage of the Solid Edge software for creating the CAD models.

Participants have the opportunity to win exciting prizes, including a 3D Connexion's Wireless SpaceMouse for the top winner and cash prizes for the first and second runners-up. All outstanding designs will receive merit certificates, and all participants will be awarded certificates of participation.

Note: This description outlines the purpose and structure of the GitHub repository. As an AI language model, I am unable to create an actual GitHub repository. You can create the repository with the suggested name, "MEA-CADCompetition-ToyDesign," and utilize it to manage the project files, documentation, and collaboration for the CAD competition.
